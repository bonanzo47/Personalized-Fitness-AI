💪 AI Fitness Planner
🧠 Personalized Diet & Exercise Recommendation System using Machine Learning
An AI-powered fitness planning web application that provides personalized diet and exercise recommendations based on BMI analysis, calorie prediction, and machine learning models trained on real-world Kaggle datasets.
The application is deployed using Streamlit and designed as a final-year academic project.

🚀 Key Features
✨ BMI Calculator with body-type visualization (Slim / Normal / Chubby / Obese)
🍽️ ML-based Diet Recommendation using nutrition data
🏋️ ML-based Exercise Recommendation with calorie burn estimation
📊 Uses real Kaggle datasets via KaggleHub
⚡ Interactive & real-time UI using Streamlit
🎓 End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → deployment)

🧠 System Workflow
1️⃣ User enters height, weight, calorie target & exercise duration
2️⃣ BMI is calculated and body type is identified
3️⃣ ML models predict:

Calorie intake (diet)
Calorie expenditure (exercise)
4️⃣ Personalized diet & exercise plans are generated
5️⃣ Results are displayed instantly in the web UI
📂 Datasets Used (Real-World Data)
🥗 1. Indian Food Nutrition Dataset
📌 Source: Kaggle
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/batthulavinay/indian-food-nutrition

Description:
This dataset contains nutritional information of Indian dishes, including calories and macro-nutrients. It is used to train a machine learning model that predicts calorie values and recommends suitable food items.

Key Columns:

Dish Name
Calories (kcal)
Protein (g)
Carbohydrates (g)
Fats (g)
Fibre (g)
Vitamins & Minerals
🏃 2. Calories Burned During Exercise Dataset
📌 Source: Kaggle
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadhavvignesh/calories-burned-during-exercise-and-activities

Description:
This dataset provides calorie expenditure for various physical activities based on different body weights. It is used to train an ML model for exercise calorie prediction.

Key Columns:

Activity, Exercise or Sport (1 hour)
130 lb
155 lb
180 lb
205 lb
Calories per kg
🧪 Machine Learning Models
🔹 Diet Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
Inputs: Protein, Carbohydrates, Fats
Output: Predicted Calories
🔹 Exercise Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
Inputs: Activity calorie values (weight-based)
Output: Calories burned per kg
📈 Models are evaluated using MAE and RMSE
